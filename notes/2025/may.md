Long time no log.  Full day of learning ahead of me, until 4pm. Currently learning about Snort. It's going well so far. When I'm done with it, I'll finalise Student finance application and enrol onto a course or two at OU. I've meditated today after a very long time of not meditating. There is so much to do every day : eat healthy, meditate, exercise, work, socialise, house maintenance, car maintenance, garden, allotment, relationships, studying, this log, etc......
