Sick day today. Very hot day today, 31Â°C (ALT+0176 for the degree symbol). Feeling very braindead. Just had an espresso, hoping it'll wake up my brain a little. Going to attempt second Checkpoint exam at Netacad Networking Basics. If I get bellow 50%, I'll do THM revisions. If I get above 70% I might do THm revisisons anyway.&#x20;
