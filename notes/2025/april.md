Day off today. Car in garage. Started my application to Open Uni and Student finances, also applied for universal credit, may potentially get Â£600 a month?&#x20;

Going to do THM today. Was going to do Python, as it's been ages since I've touched it. I'm in my room with my old Arctosa keyboard and it is sooo load, I can hear it over my headphones. At THM I'm doing Web Application Basics - [https://tryhackme.com/room/webapplicationbasics](https://tryhackme.com/room/webapplicationbasics). My notes on it are here: [https://cyber-11.gitbook.io/i-hack-i-conquer/cyber-security-101/web-hacking/web-application-basics](https://cyber-11.gitbook.io/i-hack-i-conquer/cyber-security-101/web-hacking/web-application-basics)
