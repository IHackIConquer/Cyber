Tired, headache, had a nap. I have coffee now, trying to wakeup. Downloading this rn [https://www.hirensbootcd.org/download/](https://www.hirensbootcd.org/download/) to mess around with it in virtual environment later.  Listening to this [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdXYwFleqxs\&ab\_channel=L%27atelierdeMusique](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdXYwFleqxs\&ab_channel=L%27atelierdeMusique) , it's pretty fun and chill, its very slow, so perfect to drink coffee and slowly wake up. Time to Develop a cyber security incident response plan for an organisation (AC 2.4) . Have figured out a fun answer. It's: call external cyber company. That's it :smile:&#x20;
