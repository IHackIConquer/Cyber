Very tired after bein at Mairins all day. Physical tirednes unfortunately means slow processing speed in the brain :(  I did about 10 mins of Succee with Maths, and now I'm onto Cisco Netacad Network Addressing and Basic Troubleshooting, module 1, learning about cables and shit. currently listening to [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAxm7T2nr0s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAxm7T2nr0s) . Eva is in her room learning about AI from OU.&#x20;
