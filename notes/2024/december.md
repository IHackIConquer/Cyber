Just getting over the flu. :thermometer\_face: Learning Hashing Basics from THM. Eva at work at College. Cold hand, cold feet, full belly full of beans, bad posture, need new chair and desk set up. I feel like a gremlin. Let's keep this diary safe and sound.

First day with new setup. Just realised my old Razer keyboard doesn't have this key "|" Need to swap it with a boring old Dell keyboard. Still need to get a cable for my third monitor. Evicka dela nehty, I Hack, I Conquer. It's been a week since I last done any cyber. Much to do, such little time. Advent of Cyber 2024, Day 21 to do today.&#x20;

Second day with my setup, new keyboard installed, still only 2 monitors working. Evicka dropped of at the airport. I have 3 days to hack. Jon Morris tonight, and then we hack. Day 22 of Cyber Advent '24. Learning about Kubernets and DFIR. I worry about getting a job in Cyber. Office people scary. "Wednesdays, am I right" - Ginna Linneti. In Borat voice: "My wiiiifeee" - Bob Belcher Learn all the things = get a fancy job = FIRE in Scotland or somewhere.&#x20;
