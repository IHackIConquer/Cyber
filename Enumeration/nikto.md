# Nikto

Nikto can be used to discover possible vulnerabilities including:

* Sensitive files
* Outdated servers and programs (i.e. [vulnerable web server installs](https://httpd.apache.org/security/vulnerabilities_24.html))
* Common server and software misconfigurations (Directory indexing, cgi scripts, x-ss protections)
