The benefits of security by design mindset are numerous.\
It's always easier to implement security solutions from ground up rather then implementing them after everything is in place. This allows cyber security professionals to tailor the security solution the the business making it more secure. Because of this, it also almost always cheaper. Another reason why it's more secure, is because the organisation will have defences in place right from the beginning ensures you're safe from the start. Many organisation add security after there has been an cyber incident.
