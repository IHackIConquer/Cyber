# 2. Identify why cyber security testing is important (AC 1.2)

Cybersecurity testing is an essential process that help businesses find security flaws in their systems before bad actors can take advantage of them. The type of testing mention in AC 1.1 helps organisations stay safe in regards to their devices, systems, and networks.

A good time to perform these tests is after installing new apps and introducing new infrastructure to make sure there aren't any security flaws in these new systems.

Through cybersecurity testing, organisations might find areas that are lacking sufficient cyber security. This allows them to prioritise the most important risks first, focusing their time, money and resources on fixing the biggest vulnerabilities first. Doing this seriously reduces the risk of an attack that could be debilitating to their organisation. &#x20;
