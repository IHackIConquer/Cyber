# 10b. Rigour

Rigour can be seen throughout the document. It's 18 pages, a little over 8k words. It's safe to say it's well detailed and yet still easy to read post-mortem.

The cyber forensic team discovered exactly when the initial penetration happened, how it happened, and then later when the actual breach happened and how that happened too. Reading the post mortem it's clear that BL cyber team documented everything to do with the attack and then later presented it in this document.

Rigour is important because it forces you to do things thoroughly, methodically. With rigour, you look at an attack from every angle, and examine from every which way, until it's fully understood and know how to prevent it from happening again.\
The BL's forensic cyber team created a very detailed timeline of events, including evidence of hostile reconnaissance days before the attack. This level of details is another example of rigour as cyber incidents are often extremely complex, involving multiple stages of infiltration, data exfiltration and system compromise.

With this kind of examination, you might discover more flaws within your system and help prevent even more future attacks.

Finally, by publishing a rigorous post mortem, it benefits the wider cyber community.
