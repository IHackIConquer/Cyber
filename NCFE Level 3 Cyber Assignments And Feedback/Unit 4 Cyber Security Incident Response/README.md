# UNIT 4 | Cyber security incident response

**Overall Feedback from my tutor:**\


Thank you for submitting your fourth assessment.\
\
I am pleased to inform you that you have passed this assessment, subject to moderation. You have been able to demonstrate your knowledge relating to the area of incident response through the answers you have provided. If you need to discuss this assessment further, please contact via email: grant.turnbull@lcgassociate.co.uk for further details if necessary. You have also included links to sources of information used, which indicates an element of wider reading taking place.  Your spellings and grammar are at a good standard; keep up this level of work for your next assessment.\
\
It is good to see your use of research being displayed in question 4, where you have included a link to example of an incident log.  Your answers to this question helps to show how your wider reading relates to the question and helps to provide the requirements for the answer.\
\
Within your answer to question 5 you have commented on the responsibilities of individuals to follow legal policies which relate to the need to follow the rule of law, promoting behaviours expected within society.  Your answers as a whole show that you have a good understanding of the importance of staying safe online and the need to put into place measures to ensure cyber attacks can be dealt with swiftly.\
\
Your answers linked to the theme of security post mortems are detailed; your answers to question 10 make good use of examples to help back up and explain your points.  It is important that post mortems are undertaken to learn from weaknesses and vulnerabilities within security systems.  Without a thorough incident post mortem, systems will still be exposed to data breaches and online threats.  This leads to a potential continuation of data loss, as well as breaching statutory data protection laws which would place the organisation at risk of prosecution.\
\
To help you in future assessments I would advise you to consider adding further detail to your answers.  Make sure that you keep backing up your points to explain them clearly; think about using quotes from the source materials that you have used.  Use examples to help support your answers and to make it clear to the reader that you can pass on a clear understanding of the answers you are providing.  Look through the workbook as a starting point - it contains some useful examples that you could use as a basis for further research.  Remember that here is an online  "masterclass" that you can attend, which  will give you some further tips for assessment completion. If you are interested please visit: https://shorturl.at/oaa2O

Read through the workbook associated with the next assessment and use other resources to help explain your points.  The next assessment is linked to legislation, which you have submitted.

Making sure to check through the quality of your answers for any remaining activities prior to submission.
