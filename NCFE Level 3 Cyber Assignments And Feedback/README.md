# NCFE L3 Cyber - Assignments and Feedback

This was a government funded course I started December 2024 and finished March 2025. Every unit will show my feedback from my tutor as well as my written asssignments. All assignment add up to a whopping 34k words! I'm pretty sure that's more words than I've written in my life.
