# UNIT 1 | Understanding cyber security principles



Overall Feedback from my tutor:

Thank you for submitting your first assessment. Well done - you have met the criteria for your work and have achieved your first assessment (subject to moderation). I can be contacted via email at grant.turnbull@lcgassociate.co.uk if you need extra information regarding the feedback for this assessment. I can see from your answers that you have expanded on your points and have used various examples to help back up and explain the points you have been trying to make. I can see that you have thought about how to incorporate the different command verbs used within the questions into your answers to match individual question requirements.

The detail added to question 1, where you have been asked to "describe, " has been answered with good explanations and use of examples. Question 1 in particular is of a good standard, which shows that you have used wider reading and considered the use of examples to clarify and explain your findings of the concepts of cyber security. Your answers have been able to show that you understand the need to keep safe online and how this is important to help prevent the threat of cyber attacks. The examples you use help to explain your answers and show that you are able to expand on your points and provide constructive answers and shown that you understand the importance of keeping safe online and following laws and company policies to help keep data safe. The need to follow laws is a key aspect of our society in order to help maintain high standards of security and to provide appropriate penalties for those that break these laws. Question 4 shows that you have been able to identify the core terminology in cyber security; it is important that these terms are understood as they play a key role in being able to keep safe online.

Your spellings are good, showing you have taken the time to use a spell check/proof read your work. Keep up this activity with your future assessments to help ensure accuracy of work production. For future assignments make sure you always read through your answers to make sure they make sense and are free of errors. This is a good opportunity to check that you have answered the questions with enough detail. Keep using a wide variety of sources, refenced appropriately, to help show you are engaged in further reading.

You have now shown through your work that you understand the concept of the use of understanding how to identify question command verbs and articulate your answers. Keep putting in the detail into your next set of questions and make sure you back up your points with examples. You should also think about using fact, data and quotes from sources to help back up your points; remember to reference these appropriately when you use them. Read through the workbook associated with the next assessment and use other resources to help explain your points.

I see you have already submitted your next assessment; if you feel you are ready with an assessment you can submit the work earlier that this completion date, but always remember to check through your work to make sure you have answered the questions in detail. Good luck with all of your future cyber security assessments.
