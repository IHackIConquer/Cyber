1. create link

5. the link will point to python app, the clue obtainable will point to my room to a book, page # and line# and word# and on to a next clue?

## Ideas for next treasure hunt. Started writing 23/06/25

hide 2 things in Versatile mechanical pencil&#x20;

* little piece of paper wrapped around the silver metal bit that holds the lead
* and even more secret message - add message to the actual lead in morse code. Either use knife to scratch it in, or use paint to mark it

Hide note in an old alarm clock,&#x20;

* either use memory and use the clock to remember a number??
* take it apart and leave physical message inside the case of the alarm
* or the old wiriles extender

Use numbers found on a Â£note as the next clue e.g ac80 253554

use pinzeta

use an old jar, fill with thick liquid to hide a clue

Use cyberchef to teach how to use cyberchef

hide something in the turtle lamp

hide something in the salt lamp

Can use the old ext HDD i got off ebay for something big.

use manchester encoding as a precusor to binary
