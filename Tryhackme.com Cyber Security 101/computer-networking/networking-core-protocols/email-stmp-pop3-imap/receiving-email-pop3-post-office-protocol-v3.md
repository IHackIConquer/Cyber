  An email client sends its messages by relying on SMTP and retrieves them using
  POP3. SMTP is similar to handing your envelope to the post office, and POP3 is
  similar to checking your local mailbox

# Receiving email: POP3 (Post Office Protocol v3)

Some common POP3 commands are:

* `USER <username>` identifies the user
* `PASS <password>` provides the userâ€™s password
* `STAT` requests the number of messages and total size
* `LIST` lists all messages and their sizes
* `RETR <message_number>` retrieves the specified message
* `DELE <message_number>` marks a message for deletion
* `QUIT` ends the POP3 session applying changes, such as deletions

If anyone was to capture the network packets they'd be able to get the username and password as it isn't encrypted&#x20;
