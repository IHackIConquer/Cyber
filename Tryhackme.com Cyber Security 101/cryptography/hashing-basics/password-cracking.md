# Password Cracking

Strong GPU = fast hash cracking, unless it's a Bcrypt, that's designed in a way that having a powerfull GPU doesn't help and relies only on CPU

## hashcat

Hashcat uses the following basic syntax: `hashcat -m <hash_type> -a <attack_mode> hashfile wordlist`, where:

* `-m <hash_type>` specifies the hash-type in numeric format. For example, `-m 1000` is for NTLM. Check the official documentation (`man hashcat`) and [example page](https://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=example_hashes) to find the hash type code to use.
* `-a <attack_mode>` specifies the attack-mode. For example, `-a 0` is for straight, i.e., trying one password from the wordlist after the other.
* `hashfile` is the file containing the hash you want to crack.
* `wordlist` is the security word list you want to use in your attack.

For example, `hashcat -m 3200 -a 0 hash.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt` will treat the hash as Bcrypt and try the passwords in the `rockyou.txt` file.
