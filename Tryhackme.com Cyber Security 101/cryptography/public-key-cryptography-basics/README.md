There is a fundamental issue with symmetric encryption, and the use of one key for both sender and receiver.

This is known as the problem. The key distribution problem stems from the fact that both the sender and the receiver need to know what key is being used. This means there has to be a safe and secure way to pass the key on.

Keys are pieces of information that determine the output from an encryption or decryption process, and enable multiple outputs from the same cipher.
