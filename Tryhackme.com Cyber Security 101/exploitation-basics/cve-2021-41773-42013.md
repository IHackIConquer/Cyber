# CVE-2021-41773/42013

On the 5th of October 2021, a CVE detailing a path traversal attack on Apache HTTP Server v2.4.49 was released. Assigned the number CVE-2021-41773

A Path Traversal exploit is an attack that aims to access resources that are normally inaccessible by abusing flaws in path resolution and/or normalization. We'd usually exploit this type of attack by travelling (also known as traversing) backwards beyond the supposed root using the `..` syntax.
