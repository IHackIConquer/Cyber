# DV (Developed Vetting)

This vetting takes it one step further.\
It's for individuals who are to be employee in posts which require them to have frequent and uncontrolled access to TOP SECRET assets or require any access to TOP SECRET codeword material

And for individuals who\
not in such posts will still be in position to cause same degree of damage.\
For individuals who require frequent and uncontrolled access to Category I nuclear material\
And for individuals who require access to certain levels of classified material originating from another country or international organisation

DV checks are the same ones as SC with few more additions:\
A full review of personal finances\
A detailed interview conducted by a trained Investigating Officer\
Further enquiries, including interviews with referees conducted by a trained Investigating Officer\
Checks may extend to third parties included on the security questionnaire\
The full review of personal finances will include an assessment of an individual's assets, liabilities, income and expenditure both on an individual basis and taking into account the join position with spouse or partner.
