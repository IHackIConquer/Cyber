\
**Opportunities**\
I know lot of people in various industries - civil service, healthcare, private, entertainment, law, education - this could be a potential foot in a door.\
Cyber as in industry is continually growing and will continue to do so until humans stop using the internet or a miracle will happen and someone develops a impenetrable system.\
AI will definitely change the cyber landscape in the coming years.\
\
**Threats**\
Cyber positions are in high demand, so there's big competition.\
Students just finishing their IT related degree might me more attractive candidates for employers.\
Finances are slowing me down, if I had more money, I could work less and dedicate more time to studying and pay for well recognised certificates.\
\
\
**Let's convert those negatives into positives**\
I will create a new LinkedIn account (without VPN this time) and create a professional account for everyone to see.\
I will apply for at Open University to their [BSc Cyber Security course](https://www.open.ac.uk/courses/computing-it/degrees/bsc-cyber-security-r60). Having a BSc in cyber security will great on CV and I will learn a ton.\
I'm currently enrolled in Khan Academy in the Maths course. I've started at the basics and will continue my way to high level maths.\
I currently have no cyber experience, I want to remedy this by volunteering in any IT/cyber capacity I can at Thrivemind Village, or other local social enterprises.\
I'd like to improve my communication skills. I'm going to go out of my way and find non-technical people and explain cyber concepts to them.\
To stand out from the competition, I'll have a well written CV, good cover letter and I'll do a thorough investigation of the job position and the company and come well prepared for an interview.
