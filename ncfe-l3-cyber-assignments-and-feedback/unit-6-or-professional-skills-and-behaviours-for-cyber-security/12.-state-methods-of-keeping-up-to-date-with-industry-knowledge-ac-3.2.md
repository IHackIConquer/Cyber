**Security professionals**\
My favourite way of learning is through video format so many of the cyber security professionals I follow are on Youtube\

**Professional Contacts**\
I'll work towards expanding my network of cyber security professionals, currently I only know one.\
\
**Security related social media and the dark web**\
Reddit can be a great source of information, especially r/cybersecurity. But it's important to be aware of it's strengths and weaknesses. I tend to use reddit as a starting point of my research and then use other more reliable websites to verify the information found. You can rely too heavily on reddit posts.\
Dark web is scary place, but can be used to find information that you won't find anywhere else.\
\
**Conferences**\
Talking to people either IRL or online is a fantastic way to connect and build your network of professionals you know. Cyber security events like [DEF CON ](https://defcon.org/) , [The Security Event](https://www.thesecurityevent.co.uk/), [UK Cyber Week.](https://www.ukcyberweek.co.uk/)\
Lectures, discussions, workshops, networking events, educational courses and sponsored meet ups are are all wonderful options too.
