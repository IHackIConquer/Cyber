# 3. Describe the threat intelligence lifecycle (AC 1.3)

The intelligence cycle is the process where threat information is first identified and collected, then analysed and developed into detailed plans. \
\
**Planning and direction**\
In this step cybersecurity professionals figure out what kind of intelligence is needed to prevent and respond to potential attacks.\
\
**Collection**\
This involves gathering information on current or upcoming threats from a variety of intelligence sources.\
\
**Processing**\
Raw data is processed into a more usable format for analysis such as sorting through spreadsheets, decrypting files and assessing the data for its relevance and trustworthiness.\
\
**Analysis**\
The data is analysed using various tools and techniques to check if the organisation's systems have been compromised.\
\
**Dissemination**\
A detailed threat intelligence report is created and sent to the relevant decision makers, who will decide on the next steps.\
\
**Feedback**\
Once the report is reviewed, the decision makers evaluate whether it addresses the issues and determine what actions need to be taken next.
