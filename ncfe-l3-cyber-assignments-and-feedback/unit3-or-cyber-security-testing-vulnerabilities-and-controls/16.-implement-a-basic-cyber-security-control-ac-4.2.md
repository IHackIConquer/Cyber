# 16. Implement a basic cyber security control (AC 4.2)

A tutorial on how to encrypt a file in Windows

In your file manager of choice, (I'll be using Total Commander(TC)), you can use Window's File Explorer, navigate to the folder/file that you wish to encrypt.

Right click on the file (with TC you have to right click and hold) Choose 'Properties', that's usually at the very bottom of the options given Click on the 'Advanced...' button (this will open a new window titled 'Advanced Attributes) Under Compress or Encrypt attributes, choose Encrypt contents to secure data Press 'OK' (this will close the 'Advanced Attributes window) Press 'OK' (this will close the 'Properties window" A new window will open titled Encryption Warning asking whether you'd like to encrypt the file and its parent folder or encrypt just the file. Choose the suitable option Press 'OK' (this will close the 'Encryption Warning Window and the 'Properties Window') Your file is now encrypted There will now a little yellow lock symbol on the icon of the file(If using TC, go to Properties, you'll se the yellow lock symbol on the icon in the Properties window)
