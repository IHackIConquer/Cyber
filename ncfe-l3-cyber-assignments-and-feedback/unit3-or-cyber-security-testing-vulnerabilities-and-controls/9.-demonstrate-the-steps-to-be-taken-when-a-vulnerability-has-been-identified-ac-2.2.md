# 9. Demonstrate the steps to be taken when a vulnerability has been identified (AC 2.2)

The **first step** after you identify a vulnerability, is notifying the relevant teams within the organisation, this is called an escalation. This might follow a internal escalation procedure, which may involve conveying this information to IT security personnel, system administrators, or management. \
\
The **second step** is all about priorities. Not all vulnerabilities are a major threat to the organisation. Each vulnerability needs to be evaluated and treated accordingly. What determines how an organisation responds depends on several factors, such as:\
Severity: Using CVSS to score the vulnerability based on their potential impact. Scores range from 0 to 10, with 10 being the most severe.\
\
Exploitability: Is this vulnerability just a flaw in the system, or is it something the attacker can exploit to harm the organisation?\
\
Business impact: Can this vulnerability disrupt operations, affect critical systems or sensitive data?\
\
Compliance requirements: Some vulnerabilities need to be addressed urgently to comply with regulations such as GDRP and PCI-DSS(Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard)\
\
**Third step** will usually involve deciding on the right mitigation strategy. Now that the priority of the vulnerability is decided. Mitigation strategy neds to be chosen. This can involve: Applying patches or updates, configuring security controls - firewall rule or intrusion detection systems, deploying anti-malware solutions, or implementing temporary workarounds - like disabling a feature that's allowing this vulnerability to exist.\
\
After a strategy is chosen, the next **step - four,** is applying the security measures that were chosen. This could be any of the listed above. All changes should be well documented. Depending on the organisation, they might have a Change Management Procedures, if so, the procedures need to be consulted to ensure that the new security measures do not introduce new issues or conflicts.\
\
**Step five:** Retesting and verification. It's very important do run tests on the affected systems to make sure that the vulnerability has been successfully addressed. This can look something like this: Rerunning vulnerability scans, conducting penetration testing, and or monitoring system logs and alerts. Many companies have some sort of post-remediation review processes as part of their security policies. This aims to make sure that the vulnerability have been completely resolved.
