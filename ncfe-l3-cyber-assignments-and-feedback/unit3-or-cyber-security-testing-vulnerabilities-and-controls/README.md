**Overall Feedback:**\


Thank you for submitting your third assessment.\
\
I am pleased to inform you that I have read through your answers and you have achieved the necessary criteria for each question. As a result of this, you have passed your third assessment (subject to moderation checks). If you need further information on this assessment please contact me at grant.turnbull@lcgassociate.co.uk. From reading through your answers I can see that you have used your workbook well and engaged in wider reading. You have taken into consideration the different command verbs used within the questions and have provided clearly constructed answers to match the question criteria.\
\
Your accuracy with spellings and the use of capital letters, has been good, which shows me that you are having a go at proof reading your work. There are some errors remaining, such as some missing full stops at the end of sentences, but at a level which does not impact on the understanding of your answers. Make sure you have a thorough read through with your future assessments to help ensure accuracy of work production. Remember to always read through your answers to make sure they make sense and contain enough detail to answer the question.

Within your answer to question 4 you have commented on the responsibilities of individuals to follow policies which relate to the need to follow training linked to cyber security. Legislation, such as GDPR, would be useful training to undertake.  If employees understand their legal requirements, this will promote behaviours expected within society to help in keeping data safe and secure. Further reading can be found online what can be used to help expand your notes and be useful as a source of examples.  Continue to use websites, such as the National Cyber Security Centre https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/ for facts and information.  Include detail associated with cyber security laws within your answers, where you can comment on how UK laws and company policies are used to help prevent cybercrime.

I am impressed with the effort you have put into the detail of your answers, showing that you understand the concepts linked to the questions relating to security testing. The detail added to question 15 in particular is of a good standard, which shows that you have used wider reading and looked at data from a local source to support your answer.  Your use of examples to clarify and explain your findings has helped contribute to showing your understanding of the questions and the topic covered in cyber security testing themes within this assessment as a whole.

Make sure you keep reading through the workbooks associated with the next assessments and use other resources to help explain your points.  The next assessment is linked to cyber incident response; conduct research into these threats outlined in your workbook and the legal requirements that are involved in this field of cyber security.  Your next assessment is due by 12/3/25.
