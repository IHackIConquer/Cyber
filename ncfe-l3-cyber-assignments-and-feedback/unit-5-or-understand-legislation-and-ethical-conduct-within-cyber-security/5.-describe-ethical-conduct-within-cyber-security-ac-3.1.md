# 5. Describe ethical conduct within cyber security (AC 3.1)

**Answer:**&#x43;yberethics is a much discussed topic. Both because cyber is on the rise in popularity in the past couple of decades and because ethics have a great source for conversation ever since humanity have started talking.  Ethics can be very personal as everyone views the word through a different lens and because of that, everyone considers what's 'right' and 'wrong' differently.\
Professionals working in the field of cyber security, must have strong sense of morality and ethics. It's what separates them from bad actors. It's the drive to protect the innocent, like your private medical data, or children school data from 'baddies' who attack with ransomware. \
\
The [UK Cyber Security Council](https://www.ukcybersecuritycouncil.org.uk/ethics/ethical-declaration/)  (UKCSC)have an Ethical Declaration I like. They have several points that I live by either in terms of cyber of other areas of life. And since discovering these, I'll try to adopt as many as I can into my personal and work life.\
\

It goes in to much more details [here](https://www.ukcybersecuritycouncil.org.uk/media/0f1emde3/code-of-ethics-july-2021.pdf)\
\
UKCSC have a [page ](https://www.ukcybersecuritycouncil.org.uk/ethics/ethics-scenarios/)on their website with ethics scenarios. These would be a great practice for any company or individuals. One of the scenarios goes like this:\
\
"My organisation has received a ransomware demand. Management wants to pay, but someone on the management team believes that it is inappropriate or illegal.\
Should we pay to recover our information."\
\
Another thing you can find on their website is a form where you can [report an ethical breach](https://www.ukcybersecuritycouncil.org.uk/ethics/ethical-breach-process/). After submitting a report they will begin an investigation, next the Ethics Committee will review the findings ,and lastly the verdict is carried, this could be anything from suspension of membership of the council, referral to other regulatory body/accreditation body or report to the relevant authorities if crime is suspected.
