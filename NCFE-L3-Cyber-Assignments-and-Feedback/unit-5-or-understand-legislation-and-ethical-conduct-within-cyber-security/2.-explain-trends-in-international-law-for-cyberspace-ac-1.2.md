# 2. Explain trends in international law for cyberspace (AC 1.2)

Countries mostly agree that the rules we already have partly apply to things happening online. The big discussion is about where exactly you draw the line. Every country thinks about these things differently. There's the [Budapest Convention](https://www.coe.int/en/web/cybercrime/the-budapest-convention) that over 50 countries signed, including the UK. It's an international treaty aimed at addressing cybercrime. It was created by the Council of Europe in 2001. It's main purpose is to harmonise national laws on cybercrime, improve international cooperation and establish procedures for investigating and prosecuting cybercrimes.\

Many countries are increasingly pushing for more control over their own internet and digital spaces. Some countries take it to the [extreme ](https://www.beyondidentity.com/resource/countries-with-the-most--and-least--digital-freedom)like Russia, China, Iran or Vietnam. These countries have very severe rules in place. Some of them include a complete ban of using VPNs, ban of apps like Whatsapp, and Tiktok, or shutting down internet services for entire regions.\
Another topic countries debate is the term of 'armed force' and whether hacking is part of this.\

Hottest trend is without a doubt AI. There's the[ AI act ](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/regulatory-framework-ai)by the European Commission, that "sets out clear set of risk-based rules for AI developers and deployers regarding specific uses of AI". [The Hague Academy](https://www.hagueacademy.nl/2025-centre/) of International Law have a Centre of Studies dedicated to Artificial Intelligence and International Law, where they will look at AI and the law aspect from every possible perspective.
