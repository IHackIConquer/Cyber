# 7. Explain the importance of using reliable sources of information in relation to cyber security thr

Relying on unreliable sources of information can lead to both false positives and false negatives. Both of which can waste resources and allow real threats to go unnoticed.&#x20;

A false positive is when a threat appears to exist, but actually doesn't. This causes unnecessary investigations and distractions from actual security risks, all being a waste of time and resources.\
\
A false negative is when there's an actual threat but the security team perceives it as a non-threat. This can be incredibly dangerous, for example, an attacker can access the system with the security team thinking it's nothing. This gives the attacker an advantage and more room to cause more harm. &#x20;
