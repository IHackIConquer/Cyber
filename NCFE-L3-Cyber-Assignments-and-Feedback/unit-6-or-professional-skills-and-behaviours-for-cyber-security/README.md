# UNIT 6 | Professional skills and behaviours for cyber security

**Overall Feedback from my tutor:**\


Thank you for submitting your assessment 6 answers. Well done - I have read through your answers and you have achieved the necessary criteria for each question. As a result of this, you have passed this assessment and Level 3 course, subject to moderation checks. You have used your workbooks well and engaged in wider reading taking into consideration the different command verbs used within the questions to provide clearly constructed answers to match the question criteria.\
\
Your accuracy with spellings and the use of capital letters, has been good, which shows me that you are having a go at proof reading your work. There are some errors remaining, but at a level which does not impact on the understanding of your answers. Make sure you have a thorough read through with your future assessments to help ensure accuracy of work production.  Remember to always read through your answers to make sure they make sense and contain enough detail to answer the question; the layout of paragraphs in future document creation is something to remember so that your work is easy to remember.\
\
I am impressed with the effort you have put into the detail of your answers. Your answers to the sections for question 4 show that you understand the principles of security checking and the need to ensure that a workforce is suitable for the tasks needed to be completed.  This includes trustworthiness and well an competence; you have correctly identified that there s a need to conduct vetting procedures, such as DBS checks, to ensure employees can be expected to use data appropriately.  A weak point in any organisation's security setup is the employee, where they can have access to highly sensitive data which would be valuable to a cyber criminal.\
\
Your answers to questions 7 and 8 in particular are very detailed, showing that you understand the concepts linked to cyber security skillsets. Your answers as a whole show that you have used wider reading and looked at data from from a wide variety of sources.  Your use of examples to clarify and explain your findings has helped contribute to showing your understanding of the questions and the topic covered in Assessment 6 as a whole.\
